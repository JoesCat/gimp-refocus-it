Examples of using the iterative refocus utility.

File defocus.pgm is a snapshot of text document acquired by a defocused
camera. The blur radius is about 6.5.

File restored.pgm shows result of restoration with following parameters:

 * Radius:		6.50
 * Gauss:		0.00
 * Noise:		1000.0
 * Iterations:		200
 * Boundary:		mirror boundary
 * Smoothness:		100.0
 * Area size:		3
 * Adaptive smoothing:  yes

Use the following command to produce the result:

refocus-it -r6.5 -i200 -s100.0 -n1000.0 -v1 -fdoc/defocus.pgm

or use the GIMP plug-in with the same parameters.
