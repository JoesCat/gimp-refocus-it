  * Converted deprecated gimp-2.0 code to use gimp-2.10 API, which is
    same/similar to API used for gimp3 (TODO). Image pixel crunching
    is now done in linear space regardless of if image encoding is in
    linear or other formats. The image can be encoded in any formats
    that gimp-2.10 works with (8,16,32,float,double), however pixel
    crunching is currently limited to 8bit and could use some example
    images in other precisions to try/test/debug (Future TODO?).
  * Fixed a copy-n-paste error introduced into lambda.c in version 2.1
    concerning mirror/period calculations.
  * Fixed a bug since 1.0.2 original code concerning minvar not being
    updated if maxvar initially slowly continued to rise (creating an
    incorrect minvar). Also noted two functions where the math was
    doing minvar-maxvar instead of maxvar-minvar subtractions.
  * Removed more functions that were only used by command-line program.
  * No http docs exist, however, added summary Help pop-up info.
  * ./configure --enable-debug now correctly toggles define NDEBUG.

2025-02-20 (2.1)  Joe Da Silva <digital@joescat.com>

  * Replaced deprecated INTLTOOL with GETTEXT
  * Updated configure.ac and Makefile.am from 2.54 to 2.69
  * Removed xmalloc code - We should avoid doing exit() here.
  * Simplified a lot of code with expectation of upgrading to GIMP3.
  * Inline is interesting, but the speed gains in excluding a call
    and matching return are neglible. Opted for smaller exe instead.
  * Optional float/double simplified to double since GIMP3 uses double.
  * Dropped build of cmd-line tools, since GIMP3 will use GTK3.
  * GIMP2 plugin binary name simplified to refocus-it
  * po/* locale files renamed to use gimp20-refocus-it
  * Dropped micro_version value since this is a binary, not a library.
    Distros can opt to use the micro_version value for their builds.
  * Realigned all code in src/* directory since some code followed
    different styles (TABs, spaces, {brackets}. Chose to use a more
    compact coding style similar to Fontforge 20120731 which allows
    more code to be viewed per display screen.
  * Dropped help/ directory, appeared unfinished and preliminary.
  * Moved doc/*.pgm to img/ directory since these are useful 16bpp.
  * Imported sourceforge information page into README.md and img/*.jpg

  NOTE: This is still a GIMP2 binary, and builds okay on gimp-2.10
