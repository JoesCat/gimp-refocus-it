Examples of using the iterative_refocus plug-in.

File defocus.jpg is a snapshot of text document acquired by a defocused
camera. The blur radius is about 6.5.

File restored1.jpg shows result of restoration with following parameters:

 * Radius:		6.50
 * Gauss:		0.00
 * Motion size:		0.00
 * Motion angle:	0.00
 * Noise:		1000.00
 * Iterations:		200
 * Boundary:		mirror boundary
 * Smoothness:		100.0
 * Area size:		3
 * Adaptive smoothing:  yes

File restored2.jpg shows result of restoration with following parameters:

 * Radius:		6.50
 * Gauss:		0.00
 * Motion size:		0.00
 * Motion angle:	0.00
 * Noise:		0.00
 * Iterations:		200
 * Boundary:		mirror boundary

File restored3.jpg shows result of restoration with following parameters:

 * Radius:		6.50
 * Gauss:		0.00
 * Motion size:		0.00
 * Motion angle:	0.00
 * Noise:		1000.00
 * Iterations:		200
 * Boundary:		mirror boundary
 * Smoothness:		0.0
 * Area size:		3
 * Adaptive smoothing:  yes

Notice the benefit of adaptive area smoothing.
