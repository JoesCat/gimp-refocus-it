Installation

Requirements

For installing Iterative refocus you need the following:

     * The Gimp, of course. This plug-in should work with versions > 1.2.
     * Gtk+-1.2 plus pkg-config.

   Run ./configure in the top-level directory.

   Then run make install-bin if you want to install the plug-in under
   your home directory or make install-admin-bin if you want to install
   the plug-in under your Gimp's system directory.


For installing Iterative refocus on Win32:

   Use the Makefile.msc. Don't forget to run the Vcvars32.bat batch file
   before using the Makefile.msc. It will probably be necessary to
   update some paths in Makefile.msc. Run nmake instal to install the 
   plug-in.
